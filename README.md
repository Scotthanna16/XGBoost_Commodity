# XGBoost_Commodity
This project uses various commodity and macro-economic features in order to predict if commodity prices will go up or down on a given day. We use XGBoost models to give a binary predictors. I then backtested the models, on data which was not used in training. Then, to make this more realistic, I added a transaction cost (a small percent of the cost), and proportioned the amount available for trading each commodity based on volatility, i.e. more volatility -> more risk -> less capital available for that commodity. The final overall return was 12% year over year.
